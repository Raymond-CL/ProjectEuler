Some solutions to problems in Project Euler
https://projecteuler.net

Story:
- I was doing my masters in pure mathematics back in 2010 when I got to know about the project.
- then there was this hack on the site some time later and I lost all my progress and account.
- now in 2020, while doing a doctorate in theoretical physics, I decided to revisit the problems
to pick up the maths stuff that I once dropped. Hopefully I remember.
- and with the power of github, I can save my progress now.
- The solutions will be in C++, minimal. One that doesn't involve too much compiler directives.
- One can find many solutions in github, I'll try my best to solve a problem on my own before 
searching for others' methods. If it gets too difficult in C++, I might use other languages.
